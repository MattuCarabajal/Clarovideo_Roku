# QA Automation Roku's ClaroVideo channel

> Roku's test automation tools require Roku OS 9.1 or higher.

## Overview

On this document is explained step by step how to install and execute a suit of test cases, with the rokub0-qa repositorie, for the Roku's ClaroVideo channel.

First be sure that you have enabled developer settings in your Roku device ([Instructions to enable developer settings](ConfigureRokuDevice.md)).

## Getting started

To build, configure, and test the [Roku WebDriver](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/automated-channel-testing/web-driver.md), follow these steps:  

1. [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install the Go programming language (the Roku WebDriver server is implemented as a Go application). 


2. Clone this repository or download it as a zip file.


3. Set the "GOPATH" environment variable to the path of the **rokub0-qa** folder ($APP_PATH).

4. Build the Roku WebDriver project:


5.      `cd <path>/src`
        `go build main.go`
6.     Test the Roku WebDriver server following these steps:


7. a. Install the [**assert**](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert) package, which provides testing tools to be used with Go applications.

    ```go
go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
   ```

   b. Test the ECP client:

   ```go
 go test ecpClient
   ```
   
   c. Test the HTTP server (the host is "localhost"; the port used is 9000):
   
   ```go
    go test httpServer
   ```


8. Run Roku's Python-based sample WebDriver client application following these steps: 

   a. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads) and install Python 3.9 (or higher). Set the version you install as the default version of Python on your computer.

   b. Download and install the Python package installer ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip)).

   c. Install the [**requests**](https://pypi.org/project/requests) HTTP library for Python, which enables the sample client application to send HTTP 1.1 requests:

   ```python
   python -m pip install requests
   ```

   d. Paste the latest version of the channel (**rokub0.zip**) in the **<path>/canal** directory.

   e. Open the **<path>/RobotLibrary/Library/variables.py** file and edit the ip_roku variable with the ip of your roku device and the server_address parameter with the directory of your **main.exe** file created on step 4.

   ```python
   ip_roku = '192.168.0.200'
   
   def get_variables():
      variables = {
          'ip_address': ip_roku,
          'server_path': 'C:/Roku/QA/rokub0-qa/src/main.exe',
          'timeout':  20000,
          'pressDelay': 2000
      }
      return variables
   ```

9. Open the **<path>/RobotLibrary/Tests/Utilities/variables.robot** file and edit the variables **${roku_user}** **${roku_pass}**; replacing rokudev and 1234 with your's roku device user and password, of the developer user (created when configuring the roku device), as shown in the example below.

   ```
   #Usuario y contrase√±a del usuario dev
   ${roku_user}   rokudev
   ${roku_pass}   1234
   ```

### Installing and testing the Robot Framework Library 

To install the [Roku Robot Framework Library](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/automated-channel-testing/robot-framework-library.md) and test it, follow these steps:  

1. Install the dependencies listed in the **/rokub0/RobotLibrary/requirements.txt** file:

    ```python
    python -m pip install -r /RobotLibrary/requirements.txt
    ```

2. To execute Robot tests, you must run them from the **RobotLibrary/<section>** folder as demonstrated in the following example:

    ```python
    cd <path>/RobotLibrary/Test/TestExecutionExample
    python -m robot runFirstTest.robot
    ```

3. To view the generated test case report copy and paste on your favorite web navigator the file created and shown on the cmd execution.

4. To run any specific suit just place your self on the folder of the section you want to test and execute the respective **.robot** file as shown in the step 2
